                and other services provided by us (collectively, together with the Website, our “Service”). This Policy also describes our use and disclosure of that information. By using our Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure

            <p class="">“Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual end user of the Service, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes
                information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked

            <p class="">Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable
                or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.

            <p class="">Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information</p>
            <p class="">We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways on our Service, including:</p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-mail Newsletters. We may offer e-mail newsletters with announcements and information about Milina from time to time on our Service. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail
                address. You may opt out of receiving e-mail newsletters.</p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloads, User Accounts and Profiles. Our Service or third parties may give you the ability to download Milina software, register for a Milina account or to create and update a user profile on the Service.
                If we offer such functionality on the Service, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using that functionality. This information may include, for example, your name, contact information, and system
                information, as well as information about your interests, preferences and future needs. We may indicate that some personal information is required for you to download our software, register for the account or to create the profile, while
                some is optional. To the extent that your user profile is public, we will share your Personal Information in your user profile with others in your organization.</p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated Service. You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each an “Integrated
                Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect . By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you provide, your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city,
                profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your Facebook or other Integrated Service privacy settings to understand
                and change the information sent to us through Facebook Connect or other Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.
            </p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interactive Features and Public Areas. Our Service may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Service, post comments to forums, to upload photographs and other
                content (the “User Content”), participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Service that requests or permits you to provide us with personal information
                (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User Content on any of our Service), we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features. You should be aware that any
                information you provide in chat sessions, message boards, email exchanges, newsgroups or similarly non-private areas of the Service may be read, collected, and used by others who access these areas, and this information is not Personal

                if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correspondence. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Service, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.
                We use this Personal Information to respond to your correspondence. We may also use your correspondence to improve the Service.</p>
            <p class="">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotions. We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on our Service.
                Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other
                online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.

            <h2>PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
            <p class="">When you visit our Service, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our Service, we automatically collect certain information, which may include your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser

            <p class="">We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”). We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our
                other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on our Service, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to you. If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with
                Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Policy. Otherwise, we use and
                disclose information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.

                in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to
